# Global Game Jam 2018

This project was created by James Owen, Lincoln Gardner, Louis Nguyen & myself from conception to completion over a 48 hour period.

Using the 2018 GGJ theme of Transmission, we added portals in the levels to act as shortcuts and to avoid obstacles as well as being able to use your phone as a controller.
This can be played single or multiplayer, using a keyboard or smartphone as a controller.

The Unity game and android controller builds can be found below.

(Uploads will be done shortly)
